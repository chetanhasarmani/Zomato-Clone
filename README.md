The project utilizes React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create a dynamic and responsive application. React's component-based structure allows for modular development, making it easier to manage and maintain the different parts of the application.

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the user interface. It provides a utility-first approach, allowing developers to apply pre-defined classes directly in the markup. This approach speeds up development and provides consistent styling throughout the application.

In terms of functionality, the Zomato frontend clone includes features such as restaurant listings, menu display and the ability to Dispaly restaurant in Pune. These features aim to replicate the core functionality of Zomato, allowing users to browse and order food from various restaurants.

The clone project also focuses on creating an intuitive user experience, with a clean and modern design.
